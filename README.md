This Arduino code implements a foosball table scoring system. It can actually be used with any two-player table-top game that uses point scoring with two goals.

Game options include best two out of three or best three out of five.

The Goal class implements the interface for a photoresistor and laser diode circuit that comprises the goal.  When the ball passes through the laser, blocking light to the photoresistor, a point score is registered.
